# Next.js 15 - Next/Link Component Intermittency in Dynamic Components

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 15 where the `next/link` component exhibits intermittent failure within dynamically rendered components.  The link may not function correctly, often without providing clear error messages.

## Bug Description

The `next/link` component, when used within a component rendered dynamically (e.g., based on data fetched at runtime), may not navigate correctly. This issue is not consistent and might appear intermittently.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe the behavior of the 'About Us' link. It may or may not work as expected.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `next/link` component is rendered after the data fetching is complete and the component has fully mounted.
